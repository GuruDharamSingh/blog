# Q1 2025 Personal Development Goals

This quarter I'm focusing on building sustainable habits across health, learning, and organization. The key is consistency over perfection.

## My Approach

I've learned that breaking big goals into smaller, trackable tasks makes all the difference. Each goal has specific milestones and I'm doing weekly check-ups to stay accountable.

### Reading Goal Strategy
- **Target**: 12 books (4 books per month)
- **Time commitment**: 30 minutes daily
- **Mix**: 60% non-fiction, 40% fiction
- **Tracking**: Goodreads + physical reading log

Currently working through James Clear's "Atomic Habits" which is already changing how I think about goal setting and habit formation.

### Fitness Journey
Starting with 4 workouts per week to build the habit, then I'll increase intensity. The gym membership was a good investment - having a dedicated space makes a huge difference.

**Weekly Schedule:**
- Monday: Upper body strength
- Wednesday: Cardio + core
- Friday: Lower body strength  
- Sunday: Yoga or light cardio

### TypeScript Learning Path
As a developer, staying current with technology is crucial. TypeScript is everywhere now, so dedicating time to really understand it will pay dividends.

**Learning Plan:**
1. Complete basic types and interfaces (Week 1-2) âœ…
2. Build a small project applying basics (Week 3-4)
3. Dive into advanced types (Week 5-6)
4. Contribute to an open source TypeScript project (Week 7-8)

## Weekly Check-up Process

Every Tuesday evening, I'll review:
- **Progress**: What got done vs planned
- **Challenges**: What blocked progress
- **Adjustments**: What needs to change
- **Next week**: Specific commitments

This reflection time helps me stay honest about what's working and what isn't.

## Lessons Learned So Far

1. **Start small**: Better to do 15 minutes consistently than 2 hours sporadically
2. **Environment matters**: Organizing my workspace was worth the time investment
3. **Accountability helps**: These check-ups keep me honest
4. **Flexibility is key**: Adjust the plan, don't abandon it

The goal isn't perfectionâ€”it's progress. Each week I'm building momentum and getting 1% better.
