Oh, boy, I am here at Ardra's house with her parents. probably going to move in here. looking forward to it, and the idea that we can each live out the important parts of our lives. hre travel nursing, me living in the  ashram. havent had the oppertunity to do that for awhile. 1 year since i moved in, yet feels like ive barely lived there.
