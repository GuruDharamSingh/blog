# beginning of meeting with Dana for Grant

Dana and I are meeting again to discuss the art grant that can cover 80% of a project currently in pre-production. It appears to be held by the Rothschild estate. The grant must be based in France and is intended for a sole artist working in a visual medium. We are considering a pop-up tent in one of Paris's historic neighborhoods.

Our meeting today is simply a chance to touch base and double-check the how, what, and why of the proposal, which is due in just 9 days.
